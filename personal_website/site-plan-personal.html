      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>A Handyman, or Maintenance Handyman, conducts basic maintenance on various businesses or homes. 
        The purpose of this website is to help provide handyman services to individuals who need housing services like, plumbing, electricity, 
        furniture making and regular maintainance of household machines. Our main duties include repairing plumbing systems, 
        fixing company equipment or tools and testing various company or home appliances to ensure they work properly. 
        We perform routine maintenance on a client's home or an office building. Clients will often call us to report a maintenance request, 
        we will send someone and the Handyman will quickly arrive on-site to assess the situation and repair the issue. 
        Some people in this role will complete quick or easy tasks, like simple repairs, managing several maintenance reports at once 
        and cleaning facilities. We usually work by the project, for individual customers, though some may be paid staffers for 
        maintenance companies, apartment complexes and building management companies. Some of our common duties performed by a Handyman include:

        Perform electrical repairs in community areas, including lights and laundry.
        Ensure mechanical equipment is in working order and fixed as necessary.
        Complete general building cleaning and maintenance.
        Install and replace floors, stairs and piping as needed.
        Repair and paint doors, windows, walls, ceilings, roofs and other parts of the building.
        Maintain trash and recycling receptacles around the facility.
        Maintain and repair air conditioning and heating systems as required.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        OUR SERVICES
        Home Maintainance
        Home improvement projects can feel like they last a lifetime. 
        That is primarily because there are often so many minor details that need to be handled before you can genuinely cross it off your list.
        The finishing work of a project is the most tedious and boring part. 
        But they also make the biggest difference in making the project look complete and professional. 
        Handymen have all of the skills and tools they need to pull-off those little details you don't want to do. 
        Things like caulking or cleaning grout or painting trim work. Each of those things adds up to a beautiful final product. 
        When you get a handyman to take care of the whole project, they will be sure to add all of these minor details to give you the best 
        result possible.

        Plumbing
        There aren't many things that are more annoying than leaking plumbing fixtures. 
        From the constant dripping sound to the mold and mildew that comes from the excess water, it's a big problem all around. 
        But finding the actual leak and knowing how to fix it can be a more difficult task than you'd think. 
        The job may be too much for you and still not quite big enough to call the actual plumber for. 
        That's where the handyman repair company comes in. They'll send out a professional who knows what to look for and how to fix any leaks. 
        That includes leaks under sinks, showers, toilets, washing machines, or refrigerators. 
        The quicker you can get these leaks handled, the less lasting damage you'll have.
        
        Furniture Making
        Most people don't think following incomprehensible instructions to put together a new piece of furniture sounds like a good, 
        relaxing after-work activity. And yet furniture assembly is one of the most forgotten handyman services available. 
        Don't avoid buying new furniture because you don't want to take the time to put it together. 
        A handyman service company can put together any type of furniture you need, including beds, bookshelves, desks, or tables. 
        They can even help to assemble cabinet boxes or other more permanent fixtures in your home. 
        Another bonus of having help assembling furniture is that the handyman will get it set up in its correct place. 
        No more scooting furniture inch by inch into place! Remove one of the most frustrating tasks from your list and hire a handyman!
